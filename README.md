# study-group

### Goals/Purpose

This github repo was made by students as a way to contribute to the community, so it is not open for the public to edit. Much of the code here was developed to test and will not be the most optimal way to solve a problem. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a way to help tutor students and help them study.

### TODO
1. fix factor program, when plugging in two equations where x coefficient>1 it doesn't function properly and returns a fraction, also fix perfect square functions
2. update website, make the submit button for the form cause a redirect to the chatbox
